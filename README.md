An example of a basic platformer (Mario-like) game made with GDevelop.
This game, while seeming to consist mostly of image-based sprites, betrays an effort unheard of before in gaming history.
Cheese will (hopefully) be heavily implemented as a game mechanic, and will be introduced as of the second level. 
A huge increase in the effort and budget of animation relative to the original is clearly seen, even from the opening screen.
This truly is the sequel to Michael's Bizarre Adventure.
